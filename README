First thing's first, you're going to need a system with DTrace. This likely means Solaris (or one of its decedents), OS X, or a BSD variant.  There doesn't appear to be Dtrace available for Linux :(

Still with us? Good. 

For this tutorial you'll also need: 

    node - http://nodejs.org/#download
    npm - https://github.com/isaacs/npm
    node-libdtrace - https://github.com/bcantrill/node-libdtrace
    Socket.IO – “npm install socket.io”
